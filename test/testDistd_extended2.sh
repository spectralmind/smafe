#	This script tests the transition from bulk to regular mode of smafedistd.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	Actions:
#		# expects empty database with official db dump
#		# inserts config sql file into db
#		# inserts data (94 song corpus):
#			# featurevectortype RH
#			# tracks
#			# files
#			# feature vectors
#			# distance jobs for all distance types (1 to 5)
#		# smafedistd with topk=5 -d 1 -d 2, *bulk* mode as daemon				"first run"
#		# add additional data (new fv, file, track, distancejob)
#		# wait until daemon is finished, merge logfiles
#		# query nearest neighbours of track # 23, distt # 1 and compare with reference result (textfile)
#		# query nearest neighbours of track # 46, distt # 2 and compare with reference result (textfile)
#		# ensure that each track feature vector has at least 5 "from" (outgoing) distance records
#		# check that track #2 has now 6 neighbours, one of which is the new track
#		# check that the new track has 5 neighbours
#		# check that the transition from bulk mode to regular mode took place when encountering te later
#			inserted track (grep in log file)
#		# (database and users are deleted by a following Cleanup test)

# If T0 is before T1: 	the daemon will load basic+additional data, no break between bulk and regular mode
#						-> increase WAIT_ADD_DATA
# If T0 is after T2:	daemon will enter sleep mode, without using the additional data
